Students learning Python, data handling with pandas

Educators needing to demonstrate interactive data management without files

Small-scale projects requiring temporary student record management

High-level Features
Student CRUD operations without file dependency

Unique student ID generation

Branch-wise student distribution visualized as a bar chart

Command line based menu-driven system
